i decide to to create a sling shot game because i feel like 2048 is to hard for me so change it

how i tinker

1: i found a website called ```java https://www.codebrainer.com/blog/learn-matterjs-with-examples```

it given me how to start and basic stuff but i barely understand it so


2: the same thing i found a youtube channel that hads alot of information too called `The coding Train : Matter.js physics`

but also it annoying it takes along time the video are like 20 - 30 min long and there is like 22 videos it going to take a long t

so i just give up on using it so i will just look through the video for some important stuff


3: i found out that on replit there is a template that had begginer code for matter.js which had help me more

if i change the wireframe to true all the colors of the shape are gone

 ```java
 element: document.body,
  engine: engine,
  options: {
    width: 1000,
    height: 600,
    wireframes: false
    ```

    my secondary tool is animate.js i didn't really tinker with it since i feel like it the same as animate.css

    which it kind of the same as that and i did it last year so didn't do anything with it
